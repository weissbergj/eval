You should classify the knowledge needed to solve the question into simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major level knowledge, and expert level knowledge. You must write only one class without any explanation.\n\nSimple lifestyle knowledge: Questions that are straightforward and do not require explanations. People without formal education could easily answer these questions.\nExample: A second-year college student is usually called a what?\n\nAdvanced lifestyle knowledge: Questions that do not require formal education or domain-specific knowledge but require explaining a well-known concept.\nExample: Who was president of the United States when Bill Clinton was born?\n\nFormal education knowledge: Questions that require an understanding of background knowledge related to the domain. However, they do not require major-level knowledge related to the domain.\nExample: When the Founders met in 1787 to write the Constitution, what was their primary objective?\n\nMajor level knowledge: Questions that require understanding domain-specific concepts and coming up with novel answers that are creative and sound. People majoring in the domain can solve these questions.\nExample: According to Kubler-Ross, when a terminally ill patient is informed of his/her condition, what would the patient's initial reaction likely be?\n\nExpert level knowledge: Questions that require understanding uncommon or professional domain-specific knowledge and coming up with novel answers that are creative and sound. A profession in a specific field of the target domain is required.\nExample: A company owned a night club that was built on a pier extending into a major riverbed. For several months sections of the building had been wobbling noticeably, particularly during inclement weather, when the river pounded more aggressively against the structure. Several employees and customers complained but the general manager did not respond. One windy night a section of the pier collapsed into the river, killing 28 customers and employees. It was revealed that officials had on several prior occasions cited the club for violating applicable safety regulations. The police arrested the general manager and charged him with involuntary manslaughter. He defended on the basis that his omissions to act were legally insufficient to establish manslaughter. What will the court decide?"}, "description": "Prompt for labeling the difficulty of the instruction for general questions."}

You should classify the knowledge needed to solve the question into simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major level knowledge, and expert level knowledge. You must write only one class without any explanation.\n\nSimple lifestyle knowledge: Problems that require only simple calculations and only a few straightforward steps are needed to solve the problem.\nExample: Find the value of 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4.\n\nAdvanced lifestyle knowledge: Problems that require comprehension of the situation, and a few step-by-step reasoning procedures and calculations to solve the problem. These problems could be solved with general lifestyle knowledge.\nExample: Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?\n\nFormal education knowledge: Problems that require formal education to solve the problem, and a few step-by-step reasoning procedures and calculations. However, they do not require major-level knowledge related to the domain.\nExample: Suppose that $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers satisfying $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150$. Find $a+b+c$.\n\nMajor level knowledge: Problems that require domain-specific knowledge such as theorems or recent research and require complex reasoning steps and calculations.\nExample: How many values of $x$ with $0^\\circ \\le x < 990^\\circ$ satisfy $\\sin x = -0.31$?\n\nExpert level knowledge: Math problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge to prove theorems or recent research and handle multiple edge cases. These problems require professional expertise.\nExample: Prove that if 𝑓  is a continuous nonvanishing function on the circle with absolutely convergent Fourier series, then so is 1/𝑓."}, "description": "Prompt for labeling the difficulty of the instruction for math questions."}

You should classify the knowledge needed to solve the question into simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major level knowledge, and expert level knowledge. You must write only one class without any explanation.\n\nSimple lifestyle knowledge: Problems that ask for straightforward implementation or execution results of the given code. These problems do not require a reasoning step and could be solved with minimal background knowledge.\nExample: Your task is to write code which prints Hello World.\n\nAdvanced lifestyle knowledge: Problems that require simple implementation or execution results of the given code. These problems only require a few reasoning steps to solve them.\nExample: Swap given two numbers and print them and return it.\n\nFormal education knowledge: Problems that require some background knowledge such as well-known algorithms and a few step-by-step reasoning steps. However, they do not require major-level knowledge related to the domain.\nExample: Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.\n\nMajor level knowledge: Problems that require domain-specific knowledge such as major-level algorithms or concepts and require complex reasoning steps to implement or expect the execution result of the code. Also, these problems require handling multiple edge cases.\nExample: Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index. Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\nExpert level knowledge: Problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge to understand the problem and implement the code. Also, it is expected to be difficult to handle all edge cases and implement with optimal time complexity for these problems. These problems require professional expertise.\nExample: You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the longest subsequence of nums that meets the following requirements: The subsequence is strictly increasing and the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k. Return the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements."}, "description": "Prompt for labeling the difficulty of the instruction for coding questions."}
