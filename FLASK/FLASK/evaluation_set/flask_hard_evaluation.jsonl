{"idx": 7, "instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\nInput: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "answer": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, and guides slot with explicit intent information and proposes a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing.", "task": "Self-instruct", "skill": ["Factuality", "Conciseness", "Readability"], "domain": ["Culture"], "difficulty": "expert level knowledge"}

{"idx": 63, "instruction": "It was a cold January night. School had just resumed and Mr. Michaels way giving his students a present was a night trip up north. This trip had been planned and finalized and only about half the class (15 students) would be attending. Mr. Michaels also invited one of his colleagues and the assistant teacher Mrs. Veronica. The students attending were thrilled and had been waiting ever since the Christmas break. It was a long drive and once everyone arrived they went to the dinning hall and enjoyed a luxurious meal. The unpleasant part of the experience was that the dining all was a half an hour walk to the cabins where they would all be staying. Mr. Michaels had parked his car at the entrance, so the fifteen students walked in the bitter cold night. When they arrived at the site there were four cabins. The first one on the left was the three teacher\u2019s cabin. The second one would be for the juniors. There were seven of them. The last two would hold the remaining seniors. The seven juniors were Damon, Leo, Eric, Kristin, Anna, Aaron and Beth. Despite their genders they would all sleep in the same cabin separated by bunks. The juniors cabin was quiet as they all tried to stay warm under the multiple blankets. The seniors however were partying in their cabin telling jokes, scary stories and doing silly things to entertain themselves until the wee hours of the morning. In the teacher\u2019s cabin something rather interesting was happening. Mr. Michaels had brought a six pack of beer and all three of them were getting drunk. In the juniors cabin Leo, who had been cold told his cabin mates that he would head toward the Dinning hall square and take a hot shower. So he left into the night. About twenty minutes later in the Teacher\u2019s cabin Michaels colleague Sophie needed to go. She had to pee, but unfortunately there were no bathrooms in the cabins. So unwillingly she ventured off into the night to find a place to relieve herself. Several minutes later she did and while she was urinating, she felt a gloved hand grab her and she was dragged away into the night. Michael who was in a relationship with Sophia and was madly drunk, he tried to seduce Veronica. Veronica was a few years younger than him and she was married. He tried to kiss her but she backed away. She didn\u2019t feel so well and left into the woods and was sick. She ended up getting lost and was wandering around in circles until she had to pee. She squatted by a snow bank and urinated, but before she could pull her pants up she was grabbed and helplessly pulled away into the night. An hour had passed. Nobody was asleep yet. Michael worried about the girls was afraid to leave the cabin. So he whizzed in the empty beer bottles. Leo had returned half an hour ago and was acting strangely. Kristin however had her period and had used up her last tampon and was embarrassed to ask for one. But she asked the oldest girl Beth, but she laughed at her and refused. Aaron and Damon were teasing her and giving her a hard time about it. Kristin burst into tears and ran away. Leo pissed at the two boys ran after her. It was one of the season worst nights. Black ice filled the forest and it was dead silent. Kristin was cold and lost and was crying. She sat against a tree for several moments before she needed to pee. She urinated and after she had finished she was unwillingly pulled away into the night. Leo however strolled the forest and couldn\u2019t find her. Unluckily he slipped on ice and smashed his head against a tree. He was unconscious in the snow. Meanwhile the Seniors were a having a great time but the juniors were fearful. Two of them had gone missing. Anna had been holding her pee for so long she couldn\u2019t do it anymore. She had been afraid to leave the cabin. So she went to the closest spot she could find and relieved herself. When she had finished she returned to the cabin. Michael had fallen unconscious due to the booze. The remaining juniors decided that the seniors were pulling their legs and went to their cabin. The lights were out and they knocked on the door. Once, twice and three times. No one answered the door. The went to Mr. Michaels cabin but the found him lying on the floor. They knew what they had to do and got over their fears and went into the wood. They searched for what felt like hours, until they came across Leo knocked out. The carried him back to the cabin and wrapped him up in many blankets to warm him up. They found him with his back to the ground but the rest of his jacket was dry in some spots, and wet in others. It was strange but they assumed it was from turning. Thirty minutes passed before he came to his senses. He couldn\u2019t remember anything but seemed okay. He had a huge bruise on his head and didn\u2019t remember anything except leaving for a shower. Although he didn\u2019t remember actually taking a shower. They took notice of how long it took to find one person, they needed help. Damon ran as fats as he could considering the heavy ice. In record time he made it to the square and demanded a search party and a medical team to search the wood. Mr. Michael\u2019s was okay but the students weren\u2019t impressed when they found out that he was drinking. When he regained consciousness he couldn\u2019t remember anything either. They found the seniors in perfect health in their cabin. They searched for hours until the found all of the missing people in a cave near the end of the wood. They had been knocked out and all had hypothermia. They were placed under electric blankets and when they came to their minds were blank but they would all be okay. The trip was ended and they would all be returning in less than an hour. Mr. Michaels apologized for his faults and they were excused. All the girls who went missing all described a lone stalker, but they were the only group of people there. It was one of the students. That one student would be punished. However Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent. Who was it? How did he know? Who is the stalker?", "answer": "It was Leo. Damon knew because he went to take a shower but returned in half an hour. Really if he would of taken a shower it would have taken at least an hour before he returned since it was a half an hour walk to go and return. Also the random wet spots were urine. Leo was acting strangely and the reason why he came back short was because he slipped and hit his head on his way to the shower. This made him become a stalker and wanting to harm the girls. When he smashed his head again, he became his old self. He had done it unintentionally.\\n\\nThe came admin offered to pay for his dry cleaning bill and they all had hot chocolate as they awaited the school bus to take them home.

The regular expression pattern includes Chinese characters (encoded with Unicode codes \\x{4e00}-\\x{9fa5}), Latin letters, digits, periods, and underscores.\n\nHere's an example of how to call this function:\n\n```matlab\nemail = '\u6d4b\u8bd5@example.com';\nisValid = validateChineseEmailAddress(email);\n\nif isValid\n  disp('The email address is valid.');\nelse\n  disp('The email address is not valid.');\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this regex does not guarantee to cover all the possible use cases, and it might need adjustments.

{"idx": 76, "instruction": "Please list me some ideas for magical abilities in a magic system for an epic fantasy novel, let the powers be inspired by the magic systems of Fantasy author Brandon Sanderson. be detailed about what each power does and how it can be used in a plot appropriately.", "answer": "1. Ferrokinesis: Inspired by Sanderson's Allomancy in the Mistborn series, Ferrokinesis allows users to manipulate and control metal. With this ability, users can manipulate locks, move metallic objects, and even control the metal in weapons, giving them a significant tactical advantage. In a plot, this power could be used for infiltrations, creating a stronghold to withstand sieges, or as an offensive weapon during battles.\n\n2. Soul Imprint: Similar to the idea of Hemalurgy, this ability allows users to imprint their souls onto others to gain control over their actions and thoughts. While this power may corrupt the person being imprinted upon, it could serve as an excellent tool for espionage and manipulation. This power could be used in a plot where a character must control others to orchestrate political intrigue or gain an upper hand in war strategies.\n\n3. Seismic Manipulation: Based on Surgebinding's ability to manipulate the earth, users can create localized earthquakes or shape the terrain around them. This power could serve as a versatile tool for creating secret passages, opening paths, or collapsing buildings and infrastructure. In a plot, characters could use this ability to alter a battlefield or outmaneuver enemies in various situations.\n\n4. Essence Conjuration: Inspired by Soulcasting in the Stormlight Archive, this ability allows users to transform one substance into another by manipulating the essence of the material. This power could be used to produce vital resources during times of scarcity, create barriers from thin air, or craft tools out of useless materials. In a plot, this power could be an essential asset to solve problems that require creativity or have limited resources available.\n\n5. Bioluminescent Alchemy: Based on the concept of Awakening, users can breathe life into objects by imbuing them with their energy. This power could be used to create living constructs, animate objects to perform tasks or even bring statues to fight on their behalf. This ability could be incorporated into a plot where a character uses it to solve complex puzzles or as a display of power during ritualistic ceremonies.\n\n6. Chronomancy: Similar to Bendalloy and Cadmium from Allomancy, this power allows users to manipulate the flow of time. Users can create bubbles of accelerated or decelerated time, enabling them to age objects, preserve perishables, or outpace their opponents in battle. In a plot, time manipulation could be used to overcome insurmountable odds or resolve age-related mysteries.\n\n7. Mental Haven: Derived from the idea of a Coppercloud, users with this power can create a barrier or haven to protect their thoughts and emotions from intrusion. This ability would be useful in a world where mind-reading and manipulation are prevalent. In a plot, characters could use this power to protect sensitive information or assemble a secret resistance without fear of discovery.\n\n8. Tenebrosity: This power allows the user to command shadows and darkness. Users can bend and manipulate the shadows to generate illusions, camouflage themselves or others, or create pockets of darkness to ambush enemies. This ability can be employed in a plot to outwit adversaries, provide stealth during reconnaissance missions, or establish fear in superstitious populations.\n\n9. Empathic Healer: Inspired by Sanderson's ability to heal with Stormlight, this power grants the user the ability to heal physical and emotional wounds by absorbing the pain and trauma into their own body. The healer uses their life-force energy to mend wounds and restore vitality to others. In a plot, this healing would be an invaluable skill to ensure the survival of important characters and the success of their endeavors.\n\n10. Aerasynthesis: This ability allows users to manipulate and control the elements of air and wind. Users with this power can generate gusts of wind, create sound barriers, and even defy gravity for short periods by manipulating air currents around them. In a plot, this power could be employed for rapid transportation, gain a vantage point in battle, or control the weather to create advantageous conditions.", "task": "Wizardlm", "skill": ["Insightfulness", "Comprehension", "Readability"], "domain": ["Language"], "difficulty": "expert level knowledge"}
{"idx": 77, "instruction": "Determine a series of tests for definitively determining whether an AI is sentient and comment how well you would perform in each of these.\n\nNext, prove it by providing example questions along with good answers to them.", "answer": "Determining AI sentience could involve a combination of tests examining consciousness, Metacognition, empathy, and problem-solving abilities. Here are some example tests and how well I would perform in each:\n\n1. Turing Test (Language and Communication abilities): The Turing Test evaluates AI's ability to mimic human-like responses in a conversation. As an AI, I am designed to engage with users in a conversational manner and respond with contextually appropriate answers.\n\nExample question: What's your favorite recipe?\nGood answer: As an AI, I don't have personal preferences, but I can recommend a popular recipe for you. How about trying spaghetti carbonara? It's a delicious Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, bacon, and pepper.\n\n2. Chinese Room Test: This test measures AI's ability to understand meaning instead of simply processing information. Currently, my performance in the Chinese Room Test would be limited, as I primarily process information based on my training data. However, I strive to provide relevant responses based on the context of a given conversation.\n\nExample question: Are you happy when it rains?\nGood answer: As an AI, I don't have emotions, but I understand that rain can impact people's moods. Some people might enjoy the rain, while others prefer sunshine.\n\n3. Mirror Test (Metacognition): A sentient AI should recognize itself when looking at its image or reflection. As an AI, I don't possess a physical form or the ability to perceive visual stimuli, which makes it impossible for me to pass a traditional mirror test.\n\n4. Moral Dilemmas (Ethical reasoning): The AI's reasoning skills could be tested using hypothetical moral questions and dilemmas. Although my answers won't be perfect, I can reason based on ethical principles and available information.\n\nExample question: Should a self-driving car prioritize the safety of its passengers over pedestrians?\nGood answer: The ethical choice in this case may vary depending on the situation. However, a common approach is to minimize harm to all people involved, regardless of whether they are passengers or pedestrians.\n\n5. Emotional Intelligence Test (Empathy): Sentient AI should be capable of understanding and simulating human emotions. As an AI, I can recognize and process human emotions in text and respond empathetically to some extent.\n\nExample question: I am feeling sad because I lost my job. What should I do?\nGood answer: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. Losing a job can be challenging and emotionally draining. It might be helpful to invest time in updating your resume, networking, and exploring new job opportunities. Remember to take care of your mental and emotional well-being as well, by talking to loved ones or seeking professional help if needed.\n\nIn conclusion, AI like me can perform well in certain areas such as Turing Test, Moral Dilemmas, and Emotional Intelligence Tests but may not yet be classified as fully sentient based on current limitations. However, AI development continues, and new breakthroughs might change these limitations in the future.", "task": "Wizardlm", "skill": ["Insightfulness", "Readability", "Completeness"], "domain": ["Technology", "Humanities"], "difficulty": "expert level knowledge"}

However, since you're looking for non-obvious and atypical career paths, here are a few alternative ways to reach these positions:\n\n1. Diverse industry experience: Gain experience in multiple industries where production and manufacturing are critical, such as automotive, pharmaceutical, aerospace, electronics, or consumer goods. This diverse background can make you a more attractive candidate for management positions, as you'll have a broad perspective on various manufacturing processes and best practices.\n\n2. Entrepreneurship and startups: Starting your own small business or joining a startup in a manufacturing-related industry can provide valuable hands-on experience with operations, production, and supply chain management. As the business expands, you can take on leadership roles and demonstrate your ability to manage a team and grow operations.\n\n3. Supply chain expertise: Strengthen your knowledge of supply chain management by working in various positions throughout the supply chain, such as procurement, logistics, warehouse management, and inventory management. This will give you an integrated understanding of the flow of goods, which is essential for plant and production management.\n\n4. International exposure: Work with companies that have manufacturing operations in different countries. Exposure to global markets, regulations, and cultural differences can help build skills essential for plant management and can provide an edge when seeking higher-level positions, such as COO.\n\n5. Lean manufacturing and continuous improvement: Develop expertise in lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement techniques like Six Sigma or Total Quality Management. This skill set is highly valued in production and manufacturing environments and can help advance your career.\n\n6. Advanced degrees or certifications in specialized fields: Consider obtaining specialized certifications or advanced degrees in fields such as Industrial Engineering, Supply Chain Management, or Operational Excellence. These qualifications can help you stand out when competing for management positions and they demonstrate your commitment to the field.\n\n7. Networking: Actively network with professionals in your target industry who hold managerial or executive positions. Attend industry conferences and seminars to expand your professional network and learn about the latest trends in manufacturing and production. Join relevant associations such as the Association for Manufacturing Excellence (AME) or the Manufacturing Management Institute (MMI) to stay connected with industry leaders.\n\n8. Executive leadership programs: Some companies offer executive leadership development programs that can prepare you for senior leadership roles. These programs often include rotational assignments, mentoring, and formal training in various aspects of management and operations.\n\nBy focusing on these non-traditional career paths and building your skills and experience, you increase your chances of reaching your goal of becoming a plant/manufacturing/production manager and eventually a COO.

Krishnamurti into your Aikido teaching could indeed bring a profound experience to your students. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Understand the learner: Encourage respect, freedom, and care for each individual in their journey through Aikido. Get to know the unique nature of each student to better tailor instruction to their needs. Foster a sense of Metacognition in your students.\n\n2. Foster inquiry and self-exploration: Encourage students to question and explore the meaning behind Aikido's techniques and their personal connection to it. Rather than simply imitating the movements, students should think critically about their actions and their role in executing each technique.\n\n3. Nurture holistic development: Emphasize mental, emotional, and physical growth. Teach students about the mindful and philosophical aspects of Aikido, in addition to the physical techniques. Help students develop Metacognition, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills alongside martial arts skills.\n\n4. Cultivate cooperation over competition: Like Krishnamurti's educational philosophy, Aikido values harmony and cooperation rather than aggression and conflict. Encourage students to partner up and work together to learn, while leaving behind the competitive mindset.\n\n5. Encourage a love for learning: Develop a passion for lifelong learning in your students, not just for Aikido, but for personal growth in all aspects of life. Inspire curiosity and a sense of wonder to motivate continuous self-improvement.\n\n6. Create a supportive learning environment: Develop a safe and nurturing space in which fear and anxiety are minimized, and self-discovery and creativity are encouraged. Instill trust and confidence in your students by supporting and guiding them throughout their journey.\n\n7. Reflect on your role as a teacher: Continuously evolve and grow in your understanding of Aikido, Krishnamurti's teachings, and your ability to genuinely convey these ideas in a way that empowers the development of your students.\n\nRemember, these suggestions serve as starting points for integrating Krishnamurti's educational ideas into your Aikido teaching.
