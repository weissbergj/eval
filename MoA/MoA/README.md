## Overview

Mixture of Agents (MoA) is a novel approach that leverages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs to enhance performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. By employing a layered architecture where each layer comprises several LLM agents, **MoA significantly outperforms GPT-4 Omni’s 57.5% on AlpacaEval 2.0 with a score of 65.1%**, using only open-source models!

## Quickstart: MoA in 50 LOC

To get to get started with using MoA in your own apps, see `moa.py`. You'll need to:

1. Install the Together Python library: `pip install together`
2. Get your [Together API Key](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys) & export it: `export TOGETHER_API_KEY=`
3. Run the python file: `python moa.py`

```py
# Mixture-of-Agents in 50 lines of code – see moa.py
import asyncio
import os
from together import AsyncTogether, Together

client = Together(api_key=os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY"))
async_client = AsyncTogether(api_key=os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY"))
reference_models = [
    "Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct",
    "Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat",
    "mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1",
    "databricks/dbrx-instruct",
]
aggregator_model = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1"
aggreagator_system_prompt = "...synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality response... Responses from models:"

async def run_llm(model):
    response = await async_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are some fun things to do in SF?"}],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=100,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

async def main():
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[run_llm(model) for model in reference_models])

    finalStream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=aggregator_model,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": aggreagator_system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": ",".join(str(element) for element in results)},
        ],
        stream=True,
    )

    for chunk in finalStream:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Interactive CLI Demo

This interactive CLI demo showcases a simple multi-turn chatbot where the final response is aggregated from various reference models.

### Setup

1. Export Your API Key:

   Ensure you have your [Together API key](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys) and export it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export TOGETHER_API_KEY={your_key}
   ```

2. Install Requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Demo

To run the interactive demo, execute the following script with Python:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The CLI will prompt you to input instructions interactively:

1. Start by entering your instruction at the ">>>" prompt.
2. The system will process your input using the predefined reference models.
3. It will generate a response based on the aggregated outputs from these models.
4. You can continue the conversation by inputting more instructions, with the system maintaining the context of the multi-turn interaction.

### Configuration

You can configure the demo by specifying the following parameters:

- `--aggregator`: The primary model used for final response generation.
- `--reference_models`: List of models used as references.
- `--temperature`: Controls the randomness of the response generation.
- `--max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens in the response.
- `--rounds`: Number of rounds to process the input for refinement. (num rounds == num of MoA layers - 1)
- `--num_proc`: Number of processes to run in parallel for faster execution.
- `--multi_turn`: Boolean to toggle multi-turn interaction capability.

## Evaluation

We provide scripts to quickly reproduce some of the results presented in our paper
For convenience, we have included the code from [AlpacaEval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval),
[MT-Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), and [FLASK](https://github.com/kaistAI/FLASK), with necessary modifications.
We extend our gratitude to these projects for creating the benchmarks.

### Preparation

```bash
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd alpaca_eval
pip install -e .
cd FastChat
pip install -e ".[model_worker,llm_judge]"
cd ..

# setup api keys
export TOGETHER_API_KEY=<TOGETHER_API_KEY>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

### Run AlpacaEval 2

To run AlpacaEval 2, execute the following scripts:

```
bash run_eval_alpaca_eval.sh
```

### Run MT-Bench

For a minimal example of MT-Bench evaluation, run:

```
bash run_eval_mt_bench.sh
```

### Run FLASK

For a minimal example of FLASK evaluation, run:

```
bash run_eval_flask.sh
```

### Results

We achieved top positions on both the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard and MT-Bench. Notably, on AlpacaEval 2.0, using solely open-source models, we achieved a margin of 7.6% absolute improvement from 57.5% (GPT-4 Omni) to 65.1% (MoA).

</div>

FLASK offers fine-grained evaluation of models across multiple dimensions. Our MoA method significantly outperforms the original Qwen1.5-110B-Chat on harmlessness, robustness, correctness, efficiency, factuality, commonsense, insightfulness, completeness. Additionally, MoA also outperforms GPT-4 Omni in terms of correctness, factuality, insightfulness, completeness, and metacognition.

Please feel free to contact us if you have difficulties in reproducing the results.
